This repository contains a robust and efficient solution built using the [**UiPath Automation Platform**](https://www.uipath.com) that streamlines the process of gathering real estate data 
from [zillow.com](https://www.zillow.com/), a popular online real estate marketplace. The robot is designed to extract essential information about properties in a given location, including *price*, *number of bedrooms*, *number of bathrooms*, *area (sqft)*, 
and *address*, for a maximum of 500 properties. The extracted data is then intelligently organized, filtered, and sorted according to user-defined criteria, and seamlessly integrated into an 
Excel file named **output.xlsx**. 

Having access to accurate and up-to-date property information is essential for making timely, informed decisions on property investment and management. This UiPath 
RPA robot provides a solution to efficiently collect and manage property data from internet, and can save you significant time and effort by automating the repetitive and time-consuming 
data search and entry process.

This repository includes solutions created using both **Classic Design** and **Modern Design** in UiPath Studio. _You can check out the **automation demo video** by clicking on the badge below_:
